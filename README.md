# SoundID EQ Converter

Convert speaker profile generated by SoundID Reference Measure to EqualizerAPO configuration file.

Sometimes SoundID Reference does not work with your output device or a specific audio pipeline configuration, and this script might come in handy.

## Requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.9+ for running this script
- [SoundID Reference Measure](https://store.sonarworks.com/collections/soundid-reference), a valid license, and a microphone on the measuring device to create a profile
- [EqualizerAPO](https://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/) installed on the playback device to apply the profile

## Application Notes

WARNING: Although we try to clamp the total gain, this script might still generate unexpected high gain values. **Please check the generated configuration file before applying it to your system**, otherwise it might permanently damage your ear or your audio equipment. I'm not responsible for any damage caused by using this script.

This script has only been validated with a stereo (2.0) configuration because I'm poor. If you have a multi-channel setup, please send me an exported profile so I can test and fix the script.

## Usage

0. Create a speaker profile using SoundID Reference Measure
0. Load the speaker profile to SoundID Reference using any output device
